# Developer Values

#### Disclaimer

>We recognize we live in the real world, and the things we value are often not our reality.  This collection is what we strive toward, how we aim to be better every day, our kaizen and Ulysses Pact.

## Mission statement

>Some collection of words we can return to to ensure the bearing of the ship is true.

--------


### Sane development processes

1. Any sliver of development should be able to be done end-to-end on an individual laptop.

### Robust testing

1. Sufficient and necessary testing of the limitations of our system.
  - e.g. edge cases, deploy from zero, limitations at scale.

### Sane integration and deployment processes

1. Automation is King.  The "C" in CI/CD, is continuous == automated/automatic.
  - Opening a PR should trigger checks, builds, tests...etc...
  - Merging to a default branch should check all the things, and deploy. 
1. Deployments should never interrupt user/stakeholder behavior.
  - A/B deployments, rollbacks, etc...
  - See "Sane integration and deployment"
1. Nix
  - reproducible, reliable builds.
1. The cloud is for deployments. We should not be developing directly in the cloud. 
1. We should always be able to develop without blocking, interrupting, nor breaking one another's efforts.

### Robust communication methods in a remote world.

1. Embrace asynchronous communication.
1. Psychologically safe communication environments.   

### On the matter of expertise

1. We strive to establish credibility through action and objective metrics, not words.   


### State of the art hardware

### Design Reviews?


### Sane business practices
1. We should not be paying, or managing (which is its own cost) for infrastructure, when we have no paying customers.
